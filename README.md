# Retroblocks Anniversary Mod
Wondefully retro mod for Minetest.

This is a friendly redo of the mediocrely done "Retroblocks mod"; since i thought that would be a good idea to remember the good times coding up useless stuff like this i've done this piece of improved code.

The improvements are the following ones: 

    ·Switched Mob API from "Mobs Redo" to "M.I.L.A". This mod will deactivate mobs if any other mob api is found; no need to download "M.I.L.A" since it comes by default
    ·"Playereffects" now comes for default and is compatible with other mods.
    ·Wonderfully organized code and sections, it will make you so happy that you will poop your pants due to the happiness.
    ·Improved textures with alpha added; no more ugly white/black boxes around the items or the blocks.
    
The features are the following ones:

    ·No APIs needed to run since this mod have them by default, you really don't need to download anything. If the mod detects you activated a similar API then the code of the game will run under that API.
    ·Mobs are being run under "M.I.L.A 1.0" (https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=15375), speed is assured and compatibility is guaranteed.
    ·"Playereffects" (https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=9689) is used within the game to let you fly with a "racoon feather".
    ·4 items from SMB: Fire flower, Racoon leather, mushroom and the Star
    ·7 blocks from SMB, 4 blocks from Sonic, and 1 block from Kirby
    ·4 mobs from Pacman, 3 mobs from SMB and 1 mob from adventure island
