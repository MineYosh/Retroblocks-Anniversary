# Retroblocks Anniversary Mod
Wondefully retro mod for Minetest.

This is a friendly redo of the mediocrely done "Retroblocks mod"; since i thought that would be a good idea to remember the good times coding up useless stuff like this i've done this piece of improved code.

The improvements are the following ones: 

    路Switched Mob API from "Mobs Redo" to "M.I.L.A". This mod will deactivate mobs if any other mob api is found; no need to download "M.I.L.A" since it comes by default
    路"Playereffects" now comes for default and is compatible with other mods.
    路Wonderfully organized code and sections, it will make you so happy that you will poop your pants due to the happiness.
    路Improved textures with alpha added; no more ugly white/black boxes around the items or the blocks.
    
This mod is licensed under LGPL 2.1. Totally done by "MineYoshi".
